  - "Those of of you who have known me for a while know that I have been following the development of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technologies since my days in middle school.
  - "In fact my involvement in the field of medicine and fitness has largely been driven my interest in BCIs and their potential to restore **full-motor control** in those with spinal cord injuries."
  - "And now, fantastically, it seems like my dream of a world removed of paralysis is close to becoming reality."
  - "As a result, I have decided to make myself a contact-person and advocate for those with SCI who are interested in getting involved in trials with BCI and/or who are interested in learning more about the technology."
  - "Here's what I'm offering, **voluntarily**:
    - "A website that I will be updating frequently with opportunities to get involved with BCI (e.g. trials) and with information about technological advancements."
    - "A newsletter to help notify individuals about BCI opportunities and technological advancements."

  - "Check out my site here: https://virgileblais.github.io/bci-for-sci"
  - "Sign up for my newsletter here: https://virgileblais.github.io/bci-for-sci"
